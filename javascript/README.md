Javascript is a scripting language produced by Netscape for use within HTML Web 
pages. 
JavaScript is loosely based on Java and it is built into all the major modern browsers.

JavaScript is: 

* JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language

* Complementary to and integrated with Java 
* Complementary to and integrated with HTML 
* Open and cross-platform 

A JavaScript consists of JavaScript statements that are placed within the 

    <script>... </script> 

HTML tags in a web page. 
You can place the `<script> `tag containing your JavaScript anywhere within you web page but it 
is preferred way to keep it within the `<head>` tags. 
The `<script>` tag alert the browser program to begin interpreting all the text between these 
tags as a script. 

Your First JavaScript Script: 
Let us write our class example to print out "Hello World".

    <html> 
    <body> 
    <script language="javascript" type="text/javascript"> 
    <!-- 
    document.write("Hello World!") 
    //--> 
    </script> 
    </body> 
    </html> 
Above code will display following result: 
Hello World!
